Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

Hello, I have made this Diabetes Prediction Project using Machine Learning. In this project, the objective is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features suach as
Pregnancies
Insulin Level
Age
BMI.
Following are the techniques used in my project:
1. Exploratory Data Anaylsis Of Data
2. Data Visulaization
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Machine Learning Algorithm 

Following are the algorithms which have used in the project :
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN Model
3. Randam Forest Classifier
4. Decision Tree
5. Support Vector Machine
