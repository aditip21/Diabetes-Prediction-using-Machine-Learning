Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Hello, I have made this Diabetes Prediction Project using Machine Learning. In this project, the objective is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features such as Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI. 
Following are the techniques used in my project :
•	Exploratory Data Analysis Of Data
•	Data Visualization
•	Data Preprocessing
•	Machine Learning Algorithm
Following are the algorithms which have used in the project :
•	Logistic Regression
•	KNN Model
•	Random Forest Classifier
•	Decision Tree
•	Support Vector Machine
